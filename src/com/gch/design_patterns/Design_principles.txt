Design principles:
          In software engineering, a Design Pattern describes an established solution to the most commonly
encountered problems in software design. It represents the best practices evolved over a long period
through trial and error by experienced software developers.

Design Patterns gained popularity after the book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented
Software was published in 1994 by Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson, and Richard Helm
(also known as Gang of Four or GoF).

Basically there are three types of design patterns:
1. Creational Design Patterns
2. Structural Design Patterns
3. Behavioural Design Patterns
