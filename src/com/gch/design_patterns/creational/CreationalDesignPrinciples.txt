Creational Design Pattern:
          Creational Design Patterns are concerned with the way in which objects are created. They reduce
complexities and instability by creating objects in a controlled manner.

The new operator is often considered harmful as it scatters objects all over the application. Over time
it can become challenging to change an implementation because classes become tightly coupled.

Creational Design Patterns address this issue by decoupling the client entirely from the actual
initialization process.

In this article, we'll discuss four types of Creational Design Pattern:

Singleton – Ensures that at most only one instance of an object exists throughout application
Factory Method – Creates objects of several related classes without specifying the exact object to be created
Abstract Factory – Creates families of related dependent objects
Builder – Constructs complex objects using step-by-step approach
